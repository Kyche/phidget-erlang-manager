Dependencies
============

	* libsocket   (on Ubuntu, the package happycoders-libsocket)
	* Phidget21   (available through http://www.phidgets.com/  )
	* Erlang OTP  (available through http://www.erlang.org/    )


Theory of Operation
===================

	The daemon starts a ``server`` thread that is responsible for
	communicating with Erlang clients. The thread polls for 
	messages.
	


Messages: from ``phidgetmanager`` to Erlang client
